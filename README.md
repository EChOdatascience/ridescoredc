# RideScore DC

A comprehensive bike safety scoring system for Washington D.C. streets, implementing multiple methodologies including BNA (Bike Network Analysis), LTS (Level of Traffic Stress), and others.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create street-by-street safety scores specific to the needs of cyclists in order to help them move across the city safely.  In the early phase of the project, we are exploring several already existing safety scoring models.
